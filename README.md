# Passenger Counter App

## Description
The "Passenger Counter" is a guided project from Module 3 of the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program, marking my first foray into JavaScript. This simple web app allows users to count and track the number of people entering a venue over different time periods, showcasing fundamental JavaScript operations and interactions with the DOM.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Employing the `<script>` tag to integrate JavaScript into an HTML document.
- Declaring and manipulating variables to store data.
- Working with numbers and strings to handle counting logic and display.
- Implementing functions to encapsulate reusable code.
- Directly interacting with the DOM using `getElementById()`, `innerText`, and `textContent`.

## Setup
Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file to start counting visitors in your browser.
